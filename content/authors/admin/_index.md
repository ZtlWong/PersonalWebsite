I am a second year M.S. student interested in thermal sciences and the mathematics that governs it. My love for these subject was 

And has been slowly fostered by many incredible faculty and peers at UCLA. During my time here I've had the pleasure of researching under the direction of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cTy5nxwAAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Ivan Catton</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cTy5nxwAAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Timothy Fisher</a> as part of the NTRG Lab.
